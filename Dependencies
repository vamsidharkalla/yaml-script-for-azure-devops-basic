When you define multiple jobs in a single stage, you can specify dependencies between them. Pipelines must contain at least one job with no dependencies.
Each agent can run only one job at a time. To run multiple jobs in parallel you must configure multiple agents. You also need sufficient parallel jobs.

The syntax for defining multiple jobs and their dependencies is:

jobs:
- job: string
  dependsOn: string
  condition: string
  
   jobs that build sequentially:
   
   jobs:
- job: Debug
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from the Debug build
- job: Release
  dependsOn: Debug
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from the Release build
  
  jobs that build in parallel (no dependencies):
  
  jobs:
- job: Windows
  pool:
    vmImage: 'windows-latest'
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from Windows
- job: macOS
  pool:
    vmImage: 'macOS-latest'
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from macOS
- job: Linux
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from Linux
  
  Example of fan-out:
  
  jobs:
- job: InitialJob
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from initial job
- job: SubsequentA
  dependsOn: InitialJob
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from subsequent A
- job: SubsequentB
  dependsOn: InitialJob
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from subsequent B
  
  Example of fan-in:
  
  jobs:
- job: InitialA
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from initial A
- job: InitialB
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from initial B
- job: Subsequent
  dependsOn:
  - InitialA
  - InitialB
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from subsequent
