If the primary intent of your job is to deploy your app (as opposed to build or test your app), then you can use a special type of job called deployment job.
- deployment: string        # instead of job keyword, use deployment keyword
  pool:
    name: string
    demands: string | [ string ]
  environment: string
  strategy:
    runOnce:
      deploy:
        steps:
        - script: echo Hi!
